1|You creep into this place; it’s so quiet you worry of making too much noise. There seem to be books all over the wall. On the floor, there is a 1 written.|null|null|3|null|null|
2|This room is very barren, with sand all over the floor. Various lines of clothing litter the walls. In the middle of the floor, there is a 3 written.|null|null|null|3|null|
3|You find yourself in a room with a glass DOOR in the corner, leading to an elevator. On the DOOR, there is a set of panels that show 'W N S E'. There are scroll wheels underneath each with numbers 1 through 4.|null|1|5|4|2|
4|The unexpected cold and frigidness of this room throws you off! You wonder if you should've brought your jacket. A 4 is painted in red on the wall.|null|null|null|null|3|
5|There’s paint all over the room of all different shades and colors. It’s fairly hard on your eyes, but you can just make out a 2 painted under all of the mess.|null|3|null|null|null|
6|You crawl into this small space of a door, spotting 5 wooden objects on the way in: an H, a square, a Z, a cross and a U. There’s an indentation at the end of the cluttered, tight room.|null|null|8|null|null|
7|You find yourself in a large room that has a high, but definite ceiling. It has a painting of one man reaching out to another. One looks to be surrounded by people while the other lays alone, naked.|null|null|null|8|null|
8|You’re not sure why, but you can tell this is the center of the area. You can clearly see three doors, but you can’t quite make out what’s in any of them. Some further inspection may be in order.|null|6|10|9|7|
9|You can’t quite make out what this room was supposed to be... There are some shelves with books, but most of them have been torn to shreds! Many rocks lay upon the books and are stacked close to the room’s entrance.|null|null|null|null|8|
10|A man stands patiently in the center of the room. Pews surround you left and right.|1|8|11|null|null|
11|The walls are lined with mahogany trim, and candles are spread evenly on the wall. You walk cautiously but with a purpose.|null|10|null|null|null|
12|Stepping through the doorway, you see that there are many shrubs planted around you, leading straight to a wall. The wall is covered in shrubbery and blocks your way.|null|null|15|13|null|
13|The room has flowers planted everywhere on the ground. As you step forward, you see a man slouching over some azaleas. Sweat drips from his brow.|3|null|16|null|12|
14|Walking into the room, you look around while trying to make sense of the greenhouse layout. You see a giant tree and, beside it, a run-down shed. Around the shed are unlit torches.|null|null|17|15|null|
15|In the center of the room, you see a huge apple tree. It has to be the tallest tree on the planet, or at least in this well-kept greenhouse. Since you haven't eaten in a while, you rush towards the tree hoping for a delicious apple. As you attempt to climb the tree, you hear someone yell, Who is on me?!.|2|12|18|16|14|
16|A bright amber color shines brightly as you enter the room. You start to wipe the sweat off your forehead and wonder why it is so hot with no sun ablaze. Reaching the end of the hallway, you see that there is a great, blazing fire burning in the corner of the room.|null|13|null|null|15|
17|The stench of grass fills your nose. You peek your head in the room and cautiously look around. Ahead of you is a field full of well-cut grass and a single tree grown in the field. It looks very similar to a greenhouse. This seems strange, given there’s no sunlight.|null|14|null|18|null|
18|Dozens of trees fill the room, all lined up neatly, forming a pathway. At the end of the pathway is a large heart sitting quietly in the embrace of some grass.|null|15|null|null|17|
19|There’s more water than the last room here and you can smell some kind of fish, now. A sweet young woman wearing nothing but a loose cloth sits atop a tall rock. She sings beautifully and you can’t help but be drawn in.|4|null|21|20|null|
20|You’re up to your neck in water! The only thing you can possibly see is a short piece of driftwood floating next to you. It looks to have a peg carved at one end.|null|null|null|null|19|
21|You feel a sense of adventure, and slight nausea as you rock your way into the room. The floor has almost an inch of water covering the entire floor and you can hear some sort of tantalizing music from the north. To the south, it sounds intensely quiet. A long piece of driftwood catches your eye. An indentation resembling a ‘C’ sits in the floor of the room.|null|19|22|null|null|
22|It’s nearly silent with only the sound of splashing waves against the cold, stony walls. Some scales drift in and out with the crashing waters. They might make a nice necklace.|null|21|null|23|null|
23|You’re up to your neck in water! The waters are filled with what look to be bones floating all around you, along with a lone piece of driftwood. It looks to have a peg carved at one end.|null|null|null|null|22|
24|This floor reeks of a strange cross-aroma of sweets and smoke. Surely there must be a fire somewhere nearby.|null|null|27|25|null|
25|There’s smoke bursting out of all cracks on the eastern door. You could try to touch the handle, but it looks like you might get a little too toasty.|null|null|28|26|24|
26|You burst into the room to find a raging flame, engulfing the entire room and everything in it. It even looks as if it’s leaking through some cracks of rock in the floor. A sword is scorched as it sits in the fire. There’s something in the corner of the room, where it’s the most heated.|5|null|29|null|25|
27|The sweet smell of confections grow more and more as you pace through the stone, cold cave of a room. A pair of worn slacks are curled up next to the southernmost door|null|24|30|28|null|
28|The candlelit room casts shadows from your body, making it especially hard to see due to the smoky atmosphere.|null|25|31|29|27|
29|There are many shelves along two of the walls of the small corridor of a room! So much food could fit along these shelves...! But there’s nothing but a singular granola bar sitting on the floor of the room.|null|26|32|null|28|
30|A young girl sits atop a long-legged chair. The smoke is nearly completely gone from this room. There’s some melty ice cream behind her, along with many other empty boxes of the frozen treats.|6|27|null|31|null|
31|You walk down a long hall with broken tile floor. You’re likely to cut your feet. There’s a light smoke screen to the room.|null|28|null|32|30|
32|You wander upon what looks to be a kitchen. You’re surrounded by appliances: a stove, freezer, oven, and dishwasher. It’s the coziest room you’ve visited yet!|null|29|null|null|31|
33|You are led into this room by the knight. At the center of the room you see an open treasure chest with an attack scroll inside. The knight congratulates you for choosing the correct answer.|null|null|null|34|null|
34|Following the pathway, you see two black figures at the end of the hallway. When you approach them, you see that each of the black figures have a full suit of armor on. Both are ready to start a conversation: Knights always tell the truth, knaves always lie. There are two doors: the door to a prize, and the door to punishment. ‘Both of us are knights,’ says the one guard. ‘He is a knave,’ says the other guard. Who is who here?!|null|null|36|35|33|
35|You are led into this room by the knave.  You feel a chill run down your spine and quickly turn around to see that he is blocking your way.|7|null|null|null|34|
36|Following the dull grey wall you see that there is a large heart on the ground near the exit.|null|34|37|null|null|
37|A silent breeze blows through the room. As you step in, you see that the walls are made of stone. Nothing but the door catches your eye.|null|36|null|null|null|
38|This room unsettles you slightly. Aside from a few pieces of gold, it is filled with scattered bones and all manner of weapons. You notice an unusually large bone in the corner of the room. It has an odd look to it.|null|null|41|39|null|
39|There is writing scratched on the wall of the room. You can barely make out what seems to be a riddle, 'I never was but always will be. No one ever saw me but everyone knows I exist. I give people the motivation to better themselves everyday. In a single word, what am I?' Although no one is around, you feel the urge to answer the riddle aloud. What word do you say?|null|null|42|40|38|
40|There are a few more scattered pieces of gold and armor here. This room is much less impressive than the previous ones. You notice a pair of chain mail gloves on the ground that look like they were part of a suit of armor.|null|null|43|null|39|
41|You find yourself deeper in the heart of the treasure. Here, several piles of gold are so high you are unable to see over them.|null|38|null|42|null|
42|You are overwhelmed by the sight of bright, shining gold all around you. You stand amidst piles of jewels and golden treasure.|null|39|44|43|41|
43|You enter a room filled with armor of many different types: gold, silver, bronze... One piece of armor stands out in particular. It is a chest plate that looks as though it was worn by a fierce warrior.|null|40|null|null|42|
44|As you enter the room, you see a faint golden glow ahead of you. You find yourself drawn towards the gentle golden shimmer emanating from the only exit.|null|42|null|null|null|
45|You walk up the stone stairs dragging your feet with every step of the way... You’ve reached the surface! Daylight shines brightly on your face. You feel overwhelmed with happiness. Then, something glimmers and shines brighter than your smiling face in the sun.|8|null|46|null|null|
46|Again, you find yourself in a room with two guards. One always tells the truth, and one always lies. Each guard is holding a box out to you. One box holds a treat, and the other holds a trick. You may only open one box, and you may only ask a single question to one of the guards to determine which box to open. Would you like to ask a question to the guard on the left, or the right?|null|45|null|null|null|
